# PyWinBG
A small python script to set Windows background from r/Wallpapers subreddit.

# What?
This script will:

1. Randomely select an image from r/Wallpapers hot list
2. Download it to 'Pictures' folder
3. Set it as background

# TODO
* Use Reddit API (PRAW module). Because of not using it, most probably you will get HTTP 429 (Too many requests).
